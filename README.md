# LeetCode DSA Solutions in Java  

Welcome to my repository! 🚀 Here, I upload solutions to various **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems that I solve on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com). All solutions are implemented in **Java**.  

## 📌 About  

This repository serves as a personal log of my DSA learning journey. Each problem I solve helps me improve my problem-solving skills and solidify my understanding of algorithms and data structures.  

## 🗂️ Repository Structure  

The solutions are organized as follows:  


### File Naming Convention  
- Each file is named after the problem it solves, e.g., `TwoSum.java` for the problem "Two Sum".  
- Descriptive comments at the beginning of each file explain the problem, approach, and time/space complexity.  

## 🛠️ Topics Covered  

Some of the topics include:  
- Arrays  
- Strings  
- Linked Lists  
- Trees  
- Graphs  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Recursion  
- Sorting and Searching  
- And much more!
